# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

width = 17
height = 12.0

# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and
# the type (of the value of the expression).

# width//2
# width/2.0
# height/3
# 1 + 2 * 5

# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

a = width//2

b = width/2.0

c = height/3

d = 1 + 2 * 5

print('(a) output = Floor Division returns sum that is of data type (int):', a)
print('\n' + '(b) Output = Division returns sum that is of data type (float):', b)
print('\n' + '(c) Output = Division returns sum that is of data type (float):', c)
