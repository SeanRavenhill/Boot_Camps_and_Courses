### Scientific Computing with Python - freeCodeCamp Certification

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/

During this course, I completed the following courses.

#### Python for Everybody - Free 14 hour Python course from Dr. Chuck

#### In this Root Folder: FreeCodeCamp_ComputerSciencePython

You can view my submissions to the assignments required to attain the
freeCodeCamp accreditation:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sean_ravenhill/scientific-computing-with-python-v7
(There is also a scientific-computing-with-python-v7.pdf of this file provided in the root folder.)

I was required to solve and submit 5 python programming problems.

These are archived in their corresponding folders in this root folder. There
will be a version of the program with and without comments and in the
case of the Arithmetic Formatter a second version where I wanted to test my skills
and learnings by reducing the amount of code used.

The files main.py, test_module.py would have been boilerplates already setup
to test my submissions.

There will also be a README.md with the assignments briefing.

Alternatively, you can also view each of these assignments at my Repl.it:
