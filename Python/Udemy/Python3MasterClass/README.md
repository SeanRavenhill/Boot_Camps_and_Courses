The following folders will each contain a Jupyter Notebook, where I completed
the exams and assignments require to gain my Udemy certification for this course.
I have provided the pdf of this certification in the root folder Python3MasterClass.

Filename: UC-5696b413-56ee-4d1f-9d11-e4c459d064d8.pdf

Please see the below notes and a URL link to familiarise yourself with the
course content and structure.

Alternatively please feel free to go straight to the folders and review the
Notebooks. As the exams and assignments all have an introduction and briefing
in place before my submissions.

Thanks and regards

Master Python 3! Use story based learning to go from a beginner to being able
to create real programs with Python!

Welcome to the Complete Python Masterclass Journey!

This course is designed to take you from a complete beginner in programming all
the way to becoming an effective programmer that can use Python to solve real
tasks! I'm Jose Portilla and I am the most popular Python instructor on the
Udemy platform. I've taught Python programming at Fortune 500 companies and I'm
very excited to bring the same quality of material to Udemy! Python is used by
some of the world's largest companies to accomplish all kinds of tasks.

This course is also completely different than any other course on Udemy, it
incorporates a narrative story that helps engage students and also provides
context to the different tasks you have to accomplish. We utilize project based
learning to effectively teach Python and give you the skills to put Python on
your resume. We have numerous projects and tasks for you to practice what you
are learning.

In addition to this we have Question and Answer forums where Teaching Assistants
and myself are present to help answer any questions you may have, we also have
a chat channel where you can talk to other students to team up on your own
projects!

We will cover a lot of topics in this course! Including:

- Basic Python Data Types such as numbers, variables, lists, dictionaries,
tuples, sets, and more.

- Key Control Flow - This is the logic that helps run your code, such as if,
elif, and else statements.

- Loops - We'll show you how to become an expert user of for loops and while
loops so you can effectively program.

- Functions - You will learn how to create clean, reusable functions that help
automate tasks that you repeat.

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - We will explain OOP in a clear and steady
way, helping you master one of Python's most powerful features.

- Web Scraping - Learn to use the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to
perform web scraping.

- CSV Files - You'll be able to use Python's built in csv library to work with
csv data with Python.

- PDF Files - Learn about the PyPDF2 library that allows you to read PDF files
pro grammatically.

- Zip Files - See how Python can zip files and extract information from already
compressed zip files.

- OS Module - Discover how to  perform operating system level commands with
Python's os module.

- Images - You will learn how to edit and resize images with Python.

- Decryption and Encryption - See how to use the cryptography library with
Python to encode and decode encrypted messages.

the Google Map's API to plot information on a map! and so much more!

All of this content also comes with a 30-day money back guarantee, so you can
