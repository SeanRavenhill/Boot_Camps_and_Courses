#### Boot Camps and Courses Portfolio

#### Introductory Letter:
Hello and welcome to my Boot Camps and Courses Portfolio repository.

Within this repository, you will find the assignments, project submissions,
exams and certifications that I have completed as I work towards upskilling
myself for a career in the exciting world of Programming, Development and
Data Science.

It is safe to say that I am at the beginning of this journey. However, I've
discovered a great passion for programming and code. I thoroughly enjoy working
through logic problems. The further my studies take me and the greater my
understanding of the technology and endless applications made possible through
programming, the more it feeds my desire to learn more.

My goal is to enter the industry of Data Science, Analysis, Artificial Intelligence
and Machine Learning. I believe these tools and technologies will lead the way
towards creating an improved and sustainable future for humankind, industry,
economies, the ecosystem and ultimately the promise of a better future for
all life on our planet.

We can achieve great things by utilising these incredible tools and technologies
positively and responsibly, and I want to be a part of that.
