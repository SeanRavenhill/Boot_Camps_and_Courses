Python for Everyone https://www.py4e.com/ by Dr Charles R. Severance
http://www.dr-chuck.com/ Clinical Professor University of Michigan
School of Information.

I completed this course as part of the requirements to gain my certification
in Scientific Computing with Python (https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sean_ravenhill/scientific-computing-with-python-v7)
provided by the FreeCodeCamp course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/

The following files contain the culmination of my work on the exercises
and assignments found in both the http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf
and through the website course and lessons https://www.py4e.com/.

I've structured the files & folders as such.

Each chapter is archived in a relative folder with the naming convention - ch_00_ChapterName

Within those folders, you will find .py files, Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb)
and a README.md file.

The python files will either have a naming convention of ex_00_00.py
(relating to chapter exercises) or ch_00_00_assigment.py (relates to auto-graded
assignments found on the website course materials https://www.py4e.com/assignments)

In some cases, there may not be any chapter exercises or assignments where they
were duplicates of each other. Some exercises will also not be presented as
python files, as they are very basic programs and have been shown in the Jupyter
Notebook showcases. This will explain why some of the folders are missing files
or missing chapter exercises in the folders.

For each chapter, I've used a Jupyter Notebook to showcase both the exercises
and assignments in one easy to read and review place when browsing these files
on GitHub.

Finally, the README.md file will have the briefs related to the chapter
assignments for reference, if you would prefer to review python files.
